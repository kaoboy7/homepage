<h1>2016/08/10 - Why I decided to make a personal website</h1>
<p>I've been really getting into the life hacks and productivity theories recently. I have many things I want to do and learn in my life. Most of the things I want to do involve learning new skills and becoming good at these skills. For example, I want to one day be able to sing well, play the cello, ballroom dance, start a business, make an app, write a book. I not only want to just try these different activities out, I want to be able to do do these activities well.</p>
<p>In order to get good at these things, one thing I learned is if I want to quicken my learning period I need opportunities to make mistakes, and the best way to start making mistakes is trying something new. Thus, making this website from scratch (and not from wordpress) is my way of trying something new in hopes that by me experimenting with different technologies, I will become a better programmer.</p>
<p>So I created this very simple personal website in this hopes that this will help me become a better programmer and ultimately learner. And hopefully this is just the beginning. I plan on starting and finishing many other future projects and I am excited to see where they will lead me.</p>
